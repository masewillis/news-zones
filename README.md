World Lens - What is currently the most important in a particular region?
(Written by David on 06/12/14 at 6:45 pm)

Every country and culture have its own unique perspective of the world. What are the most important news headlines on these unique places? Taking the most important local newspapers and trusted web sources, we create a worldwide visual guide of trending topics, user-specific topics and subject categories. This visual guide will provide a cultural comparison tool for those interested in international news headlines.

To solve this, we use the Rails framework for Ruby and gems, Javascript and its libraries (Jquery, *others), a variety of RSS feeds for local newspapers, a translation service API provided by Bing, and Heroku app hosting services.
